Delphi was originally developed by Borland as a rapid application development tool for Windows, and as the successor of Borland Pascal. 
Delphi and its C++ counterpart, C++Builder, shared many core components, notably the IDE and VCL, but remained separate until the release 
of RAD Studio 2007. RAD Studio is a shared host for Delphi, C++Builder, and others.

In 2006, Borlandâ€™s developer tools section were transferred to a wholly owned subsidiary known as CodeGear, 
which was sold to Embarcadero Technologies in 2008.
