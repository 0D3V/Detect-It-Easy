The Visual Component Library (abbreviated VCL) is a visual component-based object-oriented framework for developing Microsoft Windows applications. It was developed by Borland for use in, and tightly integrated with, its Delphi and C++Builder RAD tools (now owned by CodeGear, division of Embarcadero Technologies). It is written in Object Pascal.

A cross-platform equivalent of the VCL, called CLX (Component Library for Cross Platform), was later developed for use in Delphi, C++Builder and Kylix. However, it was abandoned.
